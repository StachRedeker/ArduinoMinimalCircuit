# ArduinoMinimalCircuit
> Build a minimal Arduino circuit... so you don't need an Arduino anymore. And learn something about logic gates along the way.

This project aims at explaining how to build a minimal circuit around the ATmega328P processor. The ATmega328P is commonly found in microcontroller boards such as the Arduino Uno. A minimal circuit is everything that is nessecary to use the processor. So, basically, we will be building a simpler version of the Arduino Uno.
