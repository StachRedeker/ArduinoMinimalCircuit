# ArduinoMinimalCircuit
> Build a minimal Arduino circuit... so you don't need a full Arduino anymore. And learn something about logic gates along the way.

This project aims at explaining how to build a minimal circuit around the ATmega328P processor. The ATmega328P is commonly found in microcontroller boards such as the Arduino Uno. A minimal circuit is everything that is nessecary to use the processor. So, basically, we will be building a simpler version of the Arduino Uno.

This subchapter also feels appropriate to address the [Trademark & Copyright policy](https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark) of the Arduino LLC. Altough the hardware design of the Arduino is completely open source, the name 'Arduino' is trademarked. It is therefore **not allowed** to distribute clones under the name 'Arduino' or variants of that name. This project, however, does not aim to sell an (re)branded Arduino product, nor does try to imitate Arduino. This project uses the name 'Arduino' to refer and describe existing Arduino products, namely the basic circuitry of an Arduino Uno, which is allowed as per the Trademark & Copyright policy.
